## Profile
I am a serious and diligent person with excellent analytical skills and an innate critical mindset. I am accustomed to problem-solving and troubleshooting. I enjoy spending hours debugging code and have a strong interest in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, and automation, which allow me to satisfy my need to simplify every process.
